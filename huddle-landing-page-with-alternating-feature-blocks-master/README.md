## Overview

### What I learned

The objective of creating this landing page was to test my fundamental knowledge in HTML and CSS. Throughout the project, I refrained from using any external resources, which reinforced my confidence in being able to transform a sample design into actual code using my existing skills. The design was sourced from frontendmentor.io.
